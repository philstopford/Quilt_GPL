Changelog for Quilt. A pattern generator.

4.0b1

	- Closed a loop-hole that would lead to duplicate patterns if the variations were configured, but 'None' remained as a tip setting on the subshape(s).
	- Disabled corner rounding code. Feature will not ship this round and the performance overhead is high.

4.0a5

	- Refactoring of save/load code to simplify it
	- Tip implementation.
	 - In 'input' mode, the subshape has all tips drawn; the 'output' mode shows the effects. Shared edges are subject to the internal shape rules.
	 - Allows for references of all parameters across pattern elements.
	 - Currently, this supports variations of horizontal and vertical values, with per-subshape tip definition.
	 ! Tip definitions are not a pattern definition.
	 ! Biases cannot be independently varied by subshape.

4.0a4

	- Major refactoring of various systems to allow code re-use. No user impact expected.
	 - ShapeEngine provides a common, extensible, base geometry reference.
	  - ShapeSettings is extended by Quilt with additional properties.
	  - Various components then work together to output and modify shapes.
	- Extended the relative rotation options.
	 - Previous releases presented 'World Origin' in the reference drop-down, but this was actually wrong; it was 'Self'. Renamed to avoid confusion.
	 - Added pivot options : Self, Reference, 'World Origin'.
	  - Reference will take the pivot point from the reference element.
	  - World origin will rotate about the 0,0 position.
	  - Self will rotate about the shape's midpoint.
	 - Complex relationships are now possible, including relative rotation to a reference, which is rotating about the world origin.
	- Clipper2 changes and decomposition pipeline refinements.

4.0a3

	- Stage 1 of viewport rework.
	 - Move the data preparation into multithreaded sequences.
	- Current performance comparison for large pattern decomposition of multiple islands:
	   3.2.1 205 seconds.
	   4.0a3  40 seconds.

4.0a2

	- Refactorings of code (no user impact expected).
	 - Reducing copies, etc. based on code review.
	- UI fixes for Gtk/Linux.
	 - Refresh of the viewport and user interface improved for actions just as project loading and 'input' toggling.
	- Refactorings of code (no user impact expected).
	- Keyholer updates (reverse walk) from Variance work have benefitted the results in the layout decomposition.
	- Certain OASIS files were causing trouble before. Now fixed.
	- Revisions to internal handling of GeoCore data.
	- Clipper2 update from upstream.
	- Revised some labels for clarity and added some expanders in the UI sections to reduce scrolling, if desired.
	- Use expander container to prevent non-orthogonal shapes causing UI to become too busy.
	- Adding more functionality to the context menus (listing and viewport).
	 - Ability to select linked element (effectively the overall parent of the selected element)
	 - Ability to select the reference element for X position, Y position, rotation, etc.

4.0a1

	- Adopt ClipperLib2, which allowed for some code simplification and brings performance gains.
	 - Decomposition runs in less than half the time compared to 3.2.
	- Fixed escape in decomposition pipeline for non-orthogonal geometry, exposed by new clipper library.
	 - Backported to 3.2.2 for minor performance gain and correctness.
