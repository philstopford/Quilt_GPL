Changelog for Quilt. A pattern generator.

3.2b3

	- Per user feedback, the scrolling was deemed excessive.
	 - As a compromise, the dimensions and offsets are now in a tabbed UI configuration.
	 - Reduces vertical height whilst grouping common properties together.
	 - The loss is an at-a-glance overview of all values, but the counterpoint is that the prior approach was too dense to review easily.

3.2b2

	- Fixed crash bug for certain reference element usage patterns.

3.2b1

	! Review cascading dimensional references....
	- Bug fix for CSV on export to layout.
	- Implemented option to allow dependents to take final dimension from reference in a pattern as their minimum value (length, offset).
	- Implemented a screening check in the quilt build to resolve invalid subshape references and ensure consistency.
	 - Invalid subshape references can result from a change of shape type in an element, which can only be efficiently and reliably caught at the build stage.

3.2a2

	- Implemented the ability to cancel layout loading and evaluation.
	 - Previous approach was not supported any more.
	 - The cancellation is also now supported in the rectangular decomposition library, making it ~instantaneous to cancel now.
	! Still pending a subshape-related check for shape type change of elements being referenced.
	- Reviewed the code for pattern element removal to check that related references are properly handled.
	- Resolved value retrieval for forward/backward references from changes in a1 code.
	- Tightened up the code for subshape query / index check / etc.

3.2a1

	! Value retrieval is currently broken.
	- Various clean-ups related to the new code.
	- Reworked property set/get methods to also take subshape index values.
	 - This is a major change and requires a lot of QA.
	- Refactored the source tree to make the expanded UI source more navigable.
	- Implemented reference dimension inputs (e.g. tying subshape 1 min length to subshape 2 min length in a different element.)
	 - Only equivalent dimensions are linkable in this release (horizontal length from horizontal length), but the properties can come from a different subshape in the reference element.
	 - Required significant rework of the subshape UI to make the layout work. Currently, this brings a lot more vertical scrolling.
	 ! Lots of testing required - this is quite a lot of new code and behaviors to review and adjust.

3.1

	- Refactoring UI for shape inputs. Makes adjustments easier in future and reduces complexity of code.

3.1b3

	- Refactored export pipeline to ease maintenance.
	- Allow imported layer/datatype information to be carried through the tool pipeline to export.
	- Fix to ensure text labels survive merging operation on output.

3.1b2

	- DesignLibs fixes for resizing of box and text entities.
	- DesignLibs workaround for not-yet-understood fail to register layer/datatype.
	- Allow for export layer/datatype definition through 'LxxxDxxx' element naming.

3.1b1

	- Improved handling of pre-keyholed geometry in decomposition pipeline.
	- Bug fix for multi-entry decomposition, where relative transforms were incorrectly registered for subsequent decomp passes.
	- Bug fix for merge handling of multi-island, same-layer, decomposition results.

3.1a3

	- Various small fixes and upstream enhancements.
	- Allow axis color to be changed.
	- Allow viewport background color to be changed.
	- Allow merge reference to be set on regular shapes.
	 - Exploit existing pipeline where decomposed geometry is recombined (if possible).
	> Experimental dark UI mode for Windows.
	 - macOS already supports dark mode.

3.1a2

	- Make use of error message reporting through DesignLibs for invalid layout files which previously silently failed, or worse, crashed the tool.
	- Bug fix in GeoCore where wrong variable was used to access members of tmpCel.
	- Targetting .NET 5.0.
	 - Yields a 10% performance boost.
	- Enabled independent X and Y spacing variations for arrays.

3.1a1

	- Run the keyholer before decomposition to enable loop handling.
	- Rectangular decomposition enhancements to reduce surplus rectangles.
	 - Results are going to be different from 3.0 as a result.
	 - Decomposer and raycaster have become more robust at filtering rays and screening results, to avoid undesired results and failed intersections. 
	- Variable array definition support.

3.0

	- Layout output enhancements.
	 - Support output to GZIP-compressed layout files.
	 - Expand the list of recognized file extensions.	
	- Layout input enhancements.
	 - Support GZIP-compressed layout files as input to layers.
	 - Expand the list of recognized file extensions.
	- Quilt multithreading enablement (build directive was lost).

3.0b4

	- Bug fix for dependent references when removing elements.
	- Code now considers linked element references when removing pattern elements.
	- For manual selection of 'layout' shape type, display guidance and tidy UI.
	 - Misc related bug fixes / checks and balances to avoid export fails.
	- Prevent any export for no pattern elements.
	- Viewport-based selection, using middle, or ctrl-left, mouse button to select pattern element by a proximity search to the click location.
	 - Search is multi-threaded.
	- Added an option to set the dominant direction of the rectangular decomposition raycast.
	 - Layout will need to be reloaded to re-process the decomposition when this has been changed.
	- More tooltips in UI.

	(Backported select changes from 3.0 to 2.5)

3.0b3

	- Viewport enhancements:
	 - Tooltip added.
	 - Context menu updated and now also provides hotkeys
	 - Implemented zoom-to-selected. This works in combination with the 'go to pattern' value to find the element in the given pattern and frame it in the viewport.
	 - Added 'background color' which is used in non-input mode, to mark polygons from the not-selected element.
	- Lots of work on the nested / reference layout handling.
	 - Significant work in DesignLibs to more cleanly handle these complex scenarios and to support different situations.
	 - Nested arrays are fully resolved because each element can only be a single element (or an array of single elements).
	- Fixed text entity handling for pattern definition from layout.

3.0b2

	- Added context menu entries to duplicate pattern element.
	- Strip colinear points from layout geometry being read in, using angular tolerance in the process.
	- Initial handling of cellref arrays in the pattern-from-layout system.
	 - Track the array state through from DesignLibs to Quilt. Needs some careful QA for mixed situation cases.
	 ! Recursive CellRefArray usage is not currently supported.

3.0b1

	- Context menu added to the listbox.
	- Added angular tolerance value to UI.
	 - This controls the tolerance for colinear vertex removal. Default value is 0.2, from experimentation. This is needed primarily on edges that are not axis-aligned.
	- Misc optimizations and bug fixes:
	 - GeoCore had an issue in the circle check code. This hasn't been well used before and only with certain patterns in this new usage model was the problem apparent.
	 - Insufficient decoupling of the core preview shapes list during export processing was leading to some unexpected output behavior when recomposing geometry.
	 - Enhanced the GeoWrangler method for stripping colinear vertices to improve results in angled geometry exports.
	- Storage improvements.
	 - Multi-threaded the loader, to massively improve performance loading extremely large patterns.
	- Moved pattern-from-layout to background task and introduced indeterminate progress bar to indicate work is underway.
	- Revisited non-orthogonal handling.
	 - Moved to coordinates rather than edge lengths. Coordinates can be changed, but these are not variation sources at the moment.
	 - Added support to save/load for non-orthogonal geometry.
	 - Resolved issues for mixed configurations (multi-layer, mix of ortho and non-ortho in various ways, including decomp)
	- Fix for crash related to toggling filled polygon display.
	- Fixed relative rotation regression from 2.x where reference element was in an array, but this was not array-relative.
	 - Regression introduced during the transformation pipeline overhaul. Showed in test case.
	- Fixed duplicate patterns showing up for rotations in the Quilt.
	- Added display of the quilt's pattern extent used for placement of patterns. This is not exported - it is purely a display element. Intent is to eliminate confusion about pattern placements in quilt.
	 - Configuration options (draw, color) added.
	- Optimized the relative rotation evaluation.
	 - Deep hierarchies with relative rotations used to be extremely slow. Resolved by avoiding needless recalculation of midpoints, caching the midpoint for each element during build.
	- Multiple serious issues identified and addressed with a rework of the positioning and transforms of input and final elements. QA ongoing. Backported fix to 2.x release given the serious issues identified.

3.0a5

	- Bug fix for pattern placement, backported to 2.x
	- Unify elements with same name during export.
	
3.0a4

	- Minor UI adjustment.
	- In export, the tool will track decomposed elements and unify them.
	 - Not quite as elegant as I would like, but it works and optimization can be done later.
	 - This diverges from the 'what you see is what you get' design, but decomposition is a tool approach to design definition, and reconstructing the output seems reasonable in this situation.

3.0a3

	- Support renaming of pattern elements.
	- Decomposed elements get relative positioning to the prior decomposed element. This may not be optimal, but is a general approach to try and retain general form during variations. User review will be required to adjust as-needed.
	- Decomposed elements are ordered by ascending X,Y values of lower left point.
	- Resolved issue with status label breaking layout if the content becomes large (seen primarily during testing of decomposition where many elements resulted).
	- Implemented rectangular decomposition of orthogonal geometry in geoWrangler.
	 - Required changes to the raycaster so that it could be used for the same emitter and cutter, with appropriate ray direction.
	 - Recursively carves up arbitrary orthogonal geometry to provide minimal representation.
	- Enable use of decomposed geometry in Quilt.
	 - Decomposed rectangles will show up as individual elements in the pattern.
	 - Geometry with more vertices than for a rectangle will show up as an edge list.

3.0a2

	- Support text entries from layout.
	- Replaced 'Layout' command in File menu with button and menu above the pattern list.
	  - Button will summon file dialog.
	  - Menu will show structure list from layout (when loaded). Changing structure will change the pattern.
	- Unclamped subshape 1 horizontal and vertical offset min and increment values (similar to the X and Y positions).
	- Unclamped X and Y position numeric inputs (min value and offset needed to be >= zero before).
	 - Still recommended to keep min placement values at 0, but layout patterns and other scenarios might make this useful.
	- Working to try and avoid progress bar and status bar stretching in some situations.
	- Complex pipeline overhauled.

3.0a1

	- Unlock U subshape 2 horizontal offset.
	- Prototyping work for loading in external layout for pattern construction:
	 - Can now load GDSII or Oasis using Layout option under File.
	 - Populate list of elements with polygons. Elements are type 'complex' by default in case characterization fails.
	 - Loading from layout will trigger a geometry evaluation to see whether polygons in the layout can be mapped to internal primitives (rectangle, L, T, X, S, U). In case evaluation fails (non-orthogonal or more complex transforms), a 'complex' primitive is used.
	  - Evaluation can be complex. Limited to orthogonal shapes, and grid-aligned transforms (90 degree rotation increments, flipping).
	  - For X-shapes, no transformation can be identified due to symmetry (rotation and limited clamping).
	  - For L-shapes, some combinations of flip and rotation provide indistinguishable shapes. Simplest transformation is chosen for the L constraints.
	  - For S-shapes, only 0 and 90 degree rotations can be distinguished.
	  - Geometry clean-up attempted during import (union of shapes, keyhole evaluation if required).
	 - For complex primitives, the workflow is pretty raw :
	  - UI shows edge length/increment/step values for each edge in the polygon, without awareness of how the edges might be related.
	 - Each polygon in a design layer leads to a new pattern element entry, with the LxDx name preserved.
	 - Validated that offset values construct new pattern elements, as expected.
